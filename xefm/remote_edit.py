"""Edit anywhere — remote files opened in the editor and written back (#581).

An editor can only open a file on this filesystem, so editing ``ssh://host/a.py``
means editing a local copy of it and sending that copy back: the WinSCP model.
An :class:`EditSession` is one such file — where it came from, where its copy
lives, and what the two last agreed on. :class:`EditSessions` holds them all for
the app, which drives the polling and the uploads (``XeFMApp._edit_remote``).

Three things the design turns on:

- **Saves are found by polling the copy**, not by waiting for the editor. A
  terminal editor blocks until it is done, but a GUI one returns at once and
  saves whenever the user likes, so the copy is checked for as long as the
  session lives — a cheap stat each time, and a hash only when the stat moved.
  An editor that saves by writing a new file and renaming it over the old one
  is seen the same way, since the path is what is checked.
- **The remote file is checked before every upload.** The session remembers
  the remote's mtime and size as of the download (and of each upload since);
  anything different means someone else wrote it, and the app asks before
  overwriting that. The backend's metadata cache is bypassed for that one stat
  (:func:`xefm.path.forget_cached_metadata`), or a change made within the cache's
  lifetime would go unseen.
- **The copy outlives every failure.** An upload that fails or is declined
  leaves the session *pending*, and a pending copy is never deleted — not on
  the next open, and not when XeFM exits — because it may be the only place the
  user's edit exists.

Copies live under ``~/.xefm/edit/`` in a tree that mirrors the remote path
(``edit/ssh/host/srv/app/a.py``), so the editor's title bar names the file the
user meant to open rather than a random temp name.
