"""Walking a directory tree, listing several directories at once where the
storage rewards it.

A walk costs one listing per directory. On a local disk that is a syscall and
the walk is bound by the disk; on a remote one each listing is round trips, and
a walk that waits for one directory before asking for the next is bound by
latency times the number of directories — a deep tree over SFTP spent nearly
all its time waiting. :func:`walk` keeps up to the storage's read concurrency
in flight instead (:func:`xefm.path.concurrency`), which an SFTP session serves
side by side.

Only a remote storage gets that. Overlapping listings hides round trips, and a
local listing has none to hide: the same 9,800-entry tree walked in 0.13 s one
directory at a time and 0.42 s four at once, the pool costing more than the
listings. Local walks stay the plain depth-first walk they always were.

    ``descend(entry, attrs)`` is true. A directory that cannot be listed is
    skipped, after ``on_error(directory, exception)`` when given. Stops as soon
    as ``cancel`` (a ``threading.Event``) is set, and when the consumer stops
    iterating.

    ``pool`` is the operation's own pool, for an operation that also reads
    files through it (a content search): the listings then share its workers
    with those reads, so the operation as a whole stays within the storage's
    ceiling. Without one the walk makes its own, sized by
    :func:`parallel_reads`. A walk given a pool always uses it.

    Either way the pool's threads are daemons (:mod:`xefm.worker_pool`), so
    quitting during a walk does not wait for its listings, and the walk keeps
    no more listings queued than the pool has workers — the directories it
    has yet to list wait here, not in the pool, where a file read the same
    search asks for would queue behind them.

    Order: each directory's entries come together and in its listing order.
    With one listing at a time the walk is depth-first; with several, a
    directory's entries come when its listing does, so the order across
    directories follows the storage, not the tree."""
