"""Which parts of XeFM's public API are Preview (#632).

Preview is a property of one API, not of the whole surface: a method, a class,
a ``config.py`` table or a manifest section is Preview — free to change in any
release — until it is declared stable, and the rest of the API need not wait
for it. ``API_VERSION`` promises only what is *not* Preview.

The mark lives on the definition, where whoever reads the code meets it:

- A function, method, property or class carries ``@preview``. That records it
  in :data:`PREVIEW_APIS` and opens its docstring with the word, so the source,
  ``help()`` and the registry all say the same thing. On a class it covers
  every member; a member of an unmarked class carries its own.
- A ``config.py`` table or a manifest section is not a Python object, so its
  name is listed here, below.

Stabilizing an API is deleting its mark. ``API_VERSION`` 1 was the first
release with a stable part (doc/dev/STABLE_API_PLAN.md §1 has the split).

Use is also told at run time (plan §4.1): the first time code outside XeFM
calls a Preview function or method, one line in the log names who — an
extension by its id, or ``config.py`` — and what. :func:`record_use` is that
line, and ``xefm.path_base`` calls it for a backend that subclasses a Preview
class or defines a Preview member.

Deprecated is the other mark, and the first step of removing a stable API
(doc/dev/STABLE_API_PLAN.md §9): ``@deprecated("use … instead")`` keeps the
API working, opens its docstring saying so, lists it in
:data:`DEPRECATED_APIS`, logs its first use from outside XeFM, and makes
``xefm ext check`` warn. It is removed no earlier than the next minor release,
and the removal bumps ``API_VERSION``.

This module is XeFM's own. Extensions read the result as
``xefm.user_api.PREVIEW_APIS`` and ``xefm.user_api.DEPRECATED_APIS``.
